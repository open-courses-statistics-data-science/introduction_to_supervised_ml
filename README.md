# Beginners introduction to supervised machine learning
This course provides a short introduction to supervised machine learning. It covers:

- What is machine learning?
  - Including how supervised and unsupervised methods differ
- An introduction to supervised learning: linear regression and logistic regression

The course consists of two lectures and three problem sets.


## Lectures


The lectures are:

* AM: [An introduction to supervised machine learning methods](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/presentations/intro_to_supervised_ml.html). This covers:
  * What is meant by machine learning?
  * Linear regression
  * How supervised machine learning models are trained?
  * Over- and under-fit models and validation / testing sets
* PM: [An introduction to logistic regression, kNN and decision tree methods](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/presentations/intro_to_logistic_knn_trees.html). This covers:
  * What is logistic regression and how we can train these models
  * What are k-nearest neighbour methods and how do they work
  * What are decision tree methods?

## Problem sets

There is an introductory problem set which is recommended for all newbies to machine learning:
- [using linear regression to predict house prices](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_applied_regression.nb.html). Here participants apply linear regression modelling and investigate how the model complexity affects its performance on training, validation and testing sets. The dataset used in the problem set is [here](./problem_sets/data/housing_short.csv). The answers to this exercise are in both [R](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_applied_regression_answers.nb.html) and [Python](https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_applied_regression.ipynb).

There are also the following two problem sets:

- [*Linear regression*](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_linear_regression_problems.nb.html). Here, participants train their own linear regression model and investigate how the hyperparameters of gradient descent affect training efficiency. The answers to this problem set are [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_linear_regression_problems_answers.nb.html).
- [Logistic regression](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/s_creating_logistic_regression.nb.html). Here, participants code up their own logistic regression mdoel and use it to determine the factors which influence passenger survival on the Titanic. The dataset for this problem is [here](https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/data/titanic.csv). The answers to the problem set are [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ben18785/introduction_to_supervised_ml/blob/main/problem_sets/answers/s_creating_logistic_regression_answers.nb.html).
